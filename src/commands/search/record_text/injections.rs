//! The INJECTION family: the isMeta `type:"user"` templates the harness writes into a
//! turn - `harness.enforce.*`, `harness.command.caveat`, `harness.hook.feedback`,
//! `harness.context.{image,skill,reminder}` and the relayed human message - their markers
//! and the records each one points at.
//!
//! A STUB at the skeleton amendment: the dispatch is wired here, the family's own

/// An EDGE to another record is never a variant here. Edges are SHARED on [`HitFact`]
/// itself, because several families carry them and a reader has to read every one the
/// same way; a family builds one through the shared helper instead of describing the
